# Difficulty Design in Videogames

## Introduction

Videogames differently of other mainstream art forms are an interactive media, in this interactivity is where the idea of difficulty is found. In this research I will try to analyse and explain the different aspects of diffficulty in videogames.

IMAGE 1

Starting with a more general viewing of difficulty I propose an hypothetical: You face something unknown that opposes you and you have the objective to overcome it. This situation would be a challenge by definition, then, thinking about what variables would affect the difficulty of this challenge. The most basic things that can change are the knowledge of the user about the opposing situation and the ability of the user to physically overcome it. Like this we can divide the interaction of the user with the obstacle in 2 parts: how the user understands the situations (Knowdledge), ans the ability to execute the process necessary(Skill).

We can see difficulty as a "dialogue" between the user and this hardship, as a persons knowdlege and skill increases the difficulty of something lowers to the point that if you knew everything about something and the ability required to execute it, difficulty dissapears and this "dialogue" becomes a meaningless work.
An example of this would be,if you know all the informtion in an exam and the ability to write , or you know all the patterns of an enemy and you have the ability to click the buttons precisely this becomes a trivial procedure.

## Design aspects that affect the feeling of difficulty

Knowing this there are other design elements and methods that affect the feling of difficulty of the player.

### Accesibility

Accesibility is all about easing in the player into the game, explaining how the mechanics of the game work with: tutorials (obvious or invisible), pathing slowlier the games slowlier so the player has more time to get used to it, etc. Or in other way, directly by making the game easier to play: include controller remapping in your game or even putting tools to make the game easier to play. For example, **Celeste** has an assist mode that allows you to basicly change the rules of the game, giving you extra jumps or slowing the game. 
This does not mean you are doing the game overall easier, the idea is that more people will be able to play the game.

As I said before **Celeste**'s assist mode is a very good example of making a hard game inclusive to a lot of people

And **League of Legends** has quite a good controller mapping personalization.

### Depth

Depth, the number of playable options that you have while playing a videogame, depth explains the practical complexity of a game. It's not about that the game has a lot of different things you can do in a game, is in how many ways you can solve a situation. In many videogames this is confused with adding different separated elements, that feel like the game is moslty "fluff".

IMAGE DARKSOULS CHARACTER

**Dark Souls** although having a pretty simple game combat system, that would be rolling and hitting or shooting things. The game allows you to decide how to do this things in many ways, you can move slower and have more resistance, hit harder but hit less times than quicker weapons, etc.

### Fairness
Fairness makes reference to the idea that videogames have laws and this laws are predictable, like gravity, 2 things that are equal will interact in the same way, that things you see exist, etc. For example, **I wanna be the guy** looks like a normal plataformer but nothing works like it should, plataforms disappear when you jump on them or do not appear until you jump on them, making the game incredibly difficult. 
Making something unfair to make it harder is frustraiting but if you want to make a game difficult and frustraiting is a very good option, it might seem a way to shoot yourself on the foot and it is a very artificial way to make something difficult but it is an option.

IMAGE I WANNA BE THE GY

The creators of **I wanna be the guy** wanted to make a difficult videogame so he filled with unfair things.

### Forgiveness & Punishment

The more you forgive the mistakes of a player easier it will feel, the same way if you do not forgive enough the players will be forced to quicksave or repeat big chunks of the game this way hurting the pacing of the game. Also forgiving more mistakes makes the player stay on edge and not try to restart a save every time something bad happens.
But specially depending of what you want to make the player feel, you can have a lot of margin to try things to feel freedom ( **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** ) or very fast respawn time to feel urgency ( **Super Meat Boy** ), or in plataformers like **Shovel Knight** if you fail it only sends you to the previous room and lets you recover part of your lose money so you can keep trying without a major pushback.

Image MGS5

In **Metal Gear Solid 5 : The Phantom Pain** and a lot of other stealth games, enemies do not spot you immediatly and that gives you a chance of correct your mistakes and create a more tense experience.

In the other hand, punishing the player hardly, makes it think about its decisions and incentivises the player to play more strategically.

Image XCOM2

**XCOM 2** the mechanic that soldiers die forever makes you act very carefully and not recklessly

### Randomness

Interestingly, you can alterate the difficulty of a game by including random generated elements (loot,champion enemies), duengon crawlers with random generated runs do this a lot ( **The Binding of Isaac** ) but also battle royale.
Random elements also make the player not feel as bad when they lose because they can always blame their loss on dumb luck. 

* In this kind of games skill is not determined with how good you do in the game but with how consistent you can get results playing this game

### Multiplayer Games

## Difficulty curves

## Mechanisms to altarete difficulty in games

Change Life and Damage of enemies.
Require different amounts of things from the player (precision, fastest reaction).
Changing the rules of the game. (Cooldowns)
Change the amount of rewards.
Punishing different amounts (Less money when die).
Changing the patterns of enemies.
Changin the position of enemies.
