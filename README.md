# Difficulty Design in Videogames

## Introduction

Videogames differently of other mainstream art forms are an interactive media, in this interactivity is where the idea of difficulty is found. In this research I will try to analyse and explain the different aspects of diffficulty in videogames.

Starting with a more general viewing of difficulty I propose an hypothetical: You face something unknown that opposes you and you have the objective to overcome it. This situation would be a challenge by definition, then, thinking about what variables would affect the difficulty of this challenge. The most basic things that can change are the knowledge of the user about the opposing situation and the ability of the user to physically overcome it. Like this we can divide the interaction of the user with the obstacle in 2 parts: how the user understands the situations (Knowdledge), ans the ability to execute the process necessary (Skill).

We can see difficulty as a "dialogue" between the user and this hardship, as a persons knowdlege and skill increases the difficulty of something lowers to the point that if you knew everything about something and the ability required to execute it, difficulty dissapears and this "dialogue" becomes a meaningless work.
An example of this would be,if you know all the informtion in an exam and the ability to write , or you know all the patterns of an enemy and you have the ability to click the buttons precisely this becomes a trivial procedure.

## Design aspects that affect the feeling of difficulty

Knowing this there are other design elements and methods that affect the feling of difficulty of the player.

### Accesibility

Accesibility is all about easing in the player into the game, explaining how the mechanics of the game work with: tutorials (obvious or invisible), pathing slowlier the games slowlier so the player has more time to get used to it, etc. Or in other way, directly by making the game easier to play: include controller remapping in your game or even putting tools to make the game easier to play. For example, **Celeste** has an assist mode that allows you to basicly change the rules of the game, giving you extra jumps or slowing the game. 
This does not mean you are doing the game overall easier, the idea is that more people will be able to play the game.

*Celeste's Assist mode*

As I said before **Celeste**'s assist mode is a very good example of making a hard game inclusive to a lot of people

*League of Legends controller remapping system*

And **League of Legends** has quite a good controller mapping personalization, letting you change everything that allows you to interact with the game.

### Depth

Depth, the number of playable options that you have while playing a videogame, depth explains the practical complexity of a game. It's not about that the game has a lot of different things you can do in a game, is in how many ways you can solve a situation. In many videogames this is confused with adding different separated elements, that feel like the game is moslty "fluff".

</p>
*Dark Souls 3 character creation*

**Dark Souls** although having a pretty simple game combat system, that would be rolling and hitting or shooting things. The game allows you to decide how to do this things in many ways, you can move slower and have more resistance, hit harder but hit less times than quicker weapons, etc.

### Fairness
Fairness makes reference to the idea that videogames have laws and this laws are predictable, like gravity, 2 things that are equal will interact in the same way, that things you see exist, etc. For example, **I wanna be the guy** looks like a normal plataformer but nothing works like it should, plataforms disappear when you jump on them or do not appear until you jump on them, making the game incredibly difficult. 
Making something unfair to make it harder is frustraiting but if you want to make a game difficult and frustraiting is a very good option, it might seem a way to shoot yourself on the foot and it is a very artificial way to make something difficult but it is an option.

</p>

*I wanna be the guy*

The creators of **I wanna be the guy** wanted to make a difficult videogame so he filled with unfair things.

### Forgiveness & Punishment

The more you forgive the mistakes of a player easier it will feel, the same way if you do not forgive enough the players will be forced to quicksave or repeat big chunks of the game this way hurting the pacing of the game. Also forgiving more mistakes makes the player stay on edge and not try to restart a save every time something bad happens.
But specially depending of what you want to make the player feel, you can have a lot of margin to try things to feel freedom ( **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** ) or very fast respawn time to feel urgency ( **Super Meat Boy** ), or in plataformers like **Shovel Knight** if you fail it only sends you to the previous room and lets you recover part of your lose money so you can keep trying without a major pushback.

</p>

*Metal Gear Solid 5 : The Phantom Pain*

In **Metal Gear Solid 5 : The Phantom Pain** and a lot of other stealth games, enemies do not spot you immediatly and that gives you a chance of correct your mistakes and create a more tense experience.

In the other hand, punishing the player hardly, makes it think about its decisions and incentivises the player to play more strategically.

 </p>
 
*XCOM 2*

**XCOM 2** the mechanic that soldiers die forever makes you act very carefully and not recklessly

### Randomness

Interestingly, you can alterate the difficulty of a game by including random generated elements (loot,champion enemies), duengon crawlers with random generated runs do this a lot ( **The Binding of Isaac** ) but also battle royales ( **Apex Legends** ).
Random elements also make the player not feel as bad when they lose because they can always blame their loss on dumb luck. 

(In this kind of games skill is not determined with how good you do in the game but with how consistent you can get results playing this game)

### Multiplayer Games

Multiplayer games cahnge a lot about difficulty because you are basically changing an AI for a human.

On top of all of the previous aspects your game can also be a multiplayer experience, people fighting other people is not usually cuantifiable in a difficulty scale. It depends mainly on the difference in skill beetween players and sometimes the cooperation between players, this is usually fixed by doing matchmaking, sorting the players by skill levels . 
There are a lot of differences betwen challenging a bot and a human, most importantly is about decision making and unpredictability, different to AI that have patterns, humans have techniques and things that they are used to do but people is not constant, unpredictable. 

(As i have researched AI are not programmed to play like humans because that would make them too powerfull, and most people probably could not beat it)

Thats how playing against good people feels frustraiting sometimes, people punishes other people as hard as possible and people obviously does not forgive mistakes. 
But to sumarize, how people acts against others in a game has to be managed while you set all the otheraspects of the difficulty of the game.

## Difficulty curves

Difficulty curves are a visual representation of the difficulty of a game throughout the course of the experience.
There are many diffirent types of difficulty curves that are affected by 4 factors: Accesibility, Time, Pacing, Difficulty Ceiling (Final level of skill and knowledge).
This is not how the player will experience the games as much as the main idea of the design team of how hard to make every part in a general way.

## Mechanisms to altarete difficulty in games

This are some of the different techniques used to manage different difficulties in videogames.

###__Change Life and Damage of enemies.__

-This process consists of changing the time that it takes to an enemie to die and the speed at which they kill you.
  
* Pros: Easy and cheap to do.
* Cons: It negatively affect the pacing of the game and to experienced players can feel more annoying than difficult. 
    
-Example: **Skyrim**'s diffuclty selection. 

###__Different rewards.__

-This process consists of changing the rewards given to a player depending on performance.

* Pros: If the rewards are purely symbolical this method works great for all kinds of players.
* Cons: If the rewards affect later gameplay this can affect negatively making more novice plaers repeat parts of the game, changing the pacing of the game.
    
-Example: **Tom Clancys Splinter Cell: Blacklist** gives symbolical rewards for stealth achievements.

###__Changing the rules of the game. __

-This process consists of changing the skill and experience required by the game for the player.

* Pros: It takes in consideration the different types of player, very inclusive for begginers and difficult for experts.
* Cons: Quite expensive to make.  
    
-Example:**Celeste**'s Assist mode.

###__Punishing different amounts .__

-This process consists of changing the affect of the players mistakes and how are percieved.

* Pros: Player playing in harder difficulties will feel more tension while easier will be a lo more tolerable.
* Cons: It widens the gap between easier and harder difficulties.
    
-Example:**Metal Gear Solid 5 : The Phantom Pain** in different difficulties it punishes the same mistake harder, by the enemies spoting you faster in harder modes the game can punish the same mistake distinctly.    

###__Changing the patterns of enemies.__

-This process consists of using already seen enemies and changing the patterns of them in different difficulties or stages of the game.

* Pros: Adds replayability by making different difficulties essentially different.
* Cons: Very expensive to do and many player probably wont see it.  
    
-Example: **Kingdom Hearts 2**

###__Changin the position of enemies.__

-This process consists of changing the position of enemies giving or taking strategical advantage.

* Pros: It ads depth to previous seen stages, makes things interesting to repeat, and you can reuse assest.
* Cons: If its not automated by a position randomizer can be expensive.  
    
-Example: **XCOM 2** reuses different maps and changes the position of the player and the enemies to make already seen situations interesting.

-Example: Metro Balas Money
