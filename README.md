# Difficulty Design in Videogames
## Introduction

Videogames differently of other mainstream art forms are an interactive media, in this interactivity is where the idea of difficulty is found. In this research I will try to analyse and explain the different aspects of diffficulty in videogames.

Starting with a more general viewing of difficulty I propose an hypothetical: You face something unknown that opposes you and you have the objective to overcome it. This situation would be a challenge by definition, then, thinking about what variables would affect the difficulty of this challenge. The most basic things that can change are the knowledge of the user about the opposing situation and the ability of the user to physically overcome it. Like this we can divide the interaction of the user with the obstacle in 2 parts: how the user understands the situations (Knowdledge), ans the ability to execute the process necessary(Skill).

We can see difficulty as a "dialogue" between the user and this hardship, as a persons knowdlege and skill increases the difficulty of something lowers to the point that if you knew everything about something and the ability required to execute it, difficulty dissapears and this "dialogue" becomes a meaningless work.
An example of this would be,if you know all the informtion in an exam and the ability to write , or you know all the patterns of an enemy and you have the ability to click the buttons precisely this becomes a trivial procedure.
